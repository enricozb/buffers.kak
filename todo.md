# tabs.kak - todo

## Bugs
- debug buffer ordering
- calling `delete-buffer` on a non-current buffer won't update the buflist.
- If too many buffers are open, you can't see where you're navigating.

## Features
- Show buffer modification status.
- Add wrap around when moving between tabs.
- Add `compact` mode.
- Add ephemeral mode (only show up when tabs mode menu is visible).
